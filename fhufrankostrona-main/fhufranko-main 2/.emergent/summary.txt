The AI engineer successfully built an initial general car marketplace frontend with mock data, then executed a significant pivot to a BUS/LCV specific marketplace based on detailed user requirements. This involved extensive updates to mock data and existing frontend components, followed by iterative debugging of compilation and runtime errors. Key achievements include implementing bus-specific filters, updating content, integrating real bus images, creating an interactive hero element, and developing a mock admin panel for adding listings. The process demonstrated strong debugging skills and adherence to design guidelines, constantly re-validating the UI with screenshots. The last few tasks focused on refining UI elements and content, leading up to the current request for a Kontakt page.
